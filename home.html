<p>
Welcome to Element our Matrix server hosted by Element Matrix Services, curated by your friends from x24.tools! 
</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.org/faq/">Matrix</a> is a protocol for decentralized chat, and <a href="https://element.io/">Element</a> is a popular client for that protocol.
</p>
<p>
Element exposes capabilities roughly equivalent to Slack, but with some key differences:
<ul>
	<li>Security features such as end-to-end encryption and device verification</li>
	<li>Join chat rooms on other Matrix servers via federation.</li>
	<li>Join chat rooms hosted on any external service that is compatible with the Matrix Protocol (think ICQ from long ago)</li>
	<li>Create and share access more easily to 'spaces' containing collections of 'rooms'</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
... as well as many other interesting and experimental features to get into.  Let's explore it!
