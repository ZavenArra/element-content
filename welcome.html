<h2>You have reached decentralized chat @matrix.x24.tools</h2>
<p>
Welcome to Element our Matrix server hosted by Element Matrix Services!  [Matrix](https://matrix.org/faq/) is a protocol for decentralized chat, and [Element](https://element.io/) is a popular client for that protocol.
</p>
<p>
Element exposes capabilities roughly equivalent to Slack, but with some key differences:
- Support for end-to-end encryption in direct and group messaging.
- Join chat rooms on other Matrix servers via federation.
- Join chat rooms hosted on any external service that is compatible with the Matrix Protocol
- Create and share access more easily to 'spaces' containing collections of 'rooms'
</p>
<p>
... as well as many other interesting and experimental features to get into.  Let's explore it!
